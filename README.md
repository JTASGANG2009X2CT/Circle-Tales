# Circle-Tales #
Welcome to Circle Tales, a 2D scrolling platforming game by JTAS GANG TV!

Everything all started with Circle World, a place where circles can hang out, relax, and chill with each other. Zuki was having a nice walk around town and he was as happy he could be. That was, until Soko, who was real mad about Zuki, and just wanted to destroy Circle World imediatley, so he went out to destroying and starting a big takeover at Circle World! How could this possibly happen? Who could do such a thing?! Now it is up to Zuki! Can he make it to beating Soko? Or will Circle world be destroyed into a busted up, no good, destroyed, too dangerous to come to, and very bad type of death, warzone-intensed dungeon? Play and find out as you beat each level! *NOTE: The game was inspired by something I saw called **Pythagora Switch***

Press Left - Right to walk. Hold space to run faster!

Press Up to jump and hold it to jump higher!

Press enter to glide. If you glide into an enemy, they will die, else, you will lose some of your health. If you have no health left or jump into the dent (void), you will end up dying.

Enemies are:

**Grumi:** The main of the bunch. Is very grumpy and never cares about trying to hit Zuki, but ***CAN*** hit Zuki if he touches him.

**Gora:** One of the main of the bunch. He usually tries to never hit Zuki, but unfortunately, due to his code and description, he always ends up getting forced to hit Zuki. *He got his name from Pythagora Switch by the way.*

**Gudogu:** One of the main of the bunch. He is always curious and will follow zuki to see what he is up to.
